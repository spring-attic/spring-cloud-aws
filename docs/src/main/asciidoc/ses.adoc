== Sending mails
Spring has a built-in support to send e-mails based on the https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javamail/index.html[Java Mail API]
to avoid any static method calls while using the Java Mail API and thus supporting the testability of an application.
Spring Cloud AWS supports the https://aws.amazon.com/de/ses/[Amazon SES] as an implementation of the Spring Mail abstraction.

As a result Spring Cloud AWS users can decide to use the Spring Cloud AWS implementation of the Amazon SES service or
use the standard Java Mail API based implementation that sends e-mails via SMTP to Amazon SES.

[TIP]
====
It is preferred to use the Spring Cloud AWS implementation instead of SMTP mainly for performance reasons.
Spring Cloud AWS uses one API call to send a mail message, while the SMTP protocol makes multiple requests (EHLO, MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, DATA, QUIT)
until it sends an e-mail.
====

=== Configuring the mail sender
Spring Cloud AWS provides an XML element to configure a Spring `org.springframework.mail.MailSender` implementation for the
client to be used. The default mail sender works without a Java Mail dependency and is capable of sending messages without
attachments as simple mail messages. A configuration with the necessary elements will look like this:


[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<beans xmlns:aws-mail="http://www.springframework.org/schema/cloud/aws/mail"
   xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/cloud/aws/mail
      http://www.springframework.org/schema/cloud/aws/mail/spring-cloud-aws-mail.xsd">

	<aws-context:context-credentials>
	  ..
	</aws-context:context-credentials>

	<aws-context:context-region region="eu-west-1" />

	<aws-mail:mail-sender id="testSender" />

</beans>
----

=== Sending simple mails
Application developers can inject the `MailSender` into their application code and directly send simple text based e-mail
messages. The sample below demonstrates the creation of a simple mail message.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class MailSendingService {

	private MailSender mailSender;

	@Autowired
	public MailSendingService(MailSender mailSender) {
		this.mailSender = mailSender;
	}

	public void sendMailMessage() {
		SimpleMailMessage simpleMailMessage = new SimpleMailMessage();
		simpleMailMessage.setFrom("foo@bar.com");
		simpleMailMessage.setTo("bar@baz.com");
		simpleMailMessage.setSubject("test subject");
		simpleMailMessage.setText("test content");
		this.mailSender.send(simpleMailMessage);
	}
}
----


=== Sending attachments
Sending attachments with e-mail requires MIME messages to be created and sent. In order to create MIME messages,
the Java Mail dependency is required and has to be included in the classpath. Spring Cloud AWS will detect the
dependency and create a `org.springframework.mail.javamail.JavaMailSender` implementation that allows to create and
build MIME messages and send them. A dependency configuration for the Java Mail API is the only change in the configuration
which is shown below.

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>javax.mail</groupId>
	<artifactId>mailapi</artifactId>
	<version>1.4.1</version>
	<exclusions>
		<!-- exclusion because we are running on Java 1.7 that includes the activation API by default-->
		<exclusion>
			<artifactId>activation</artifactId>
			<groupId>javax.activation</groupId>
		</exclusion>
	</exclusions>
</dependency>
----

[NOTE]
====
Even though there is a dependency to the Java Mail API there is still the Amazon SES API used underneath to send mail
messages. There is no https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-smtp.html[SMTP setup] required
on the Amazon AWS side.
====

Sending the mail requires the application developer to use the `JavaMailSender` to send an e-mail as shown in the example
below.

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public class MailSendingService {

	private JavaMailSender mailSender;

   	@Autowired
	public MailSendingService(JavaMailSender mailSender) {
		this.mailSender = mailSender;
	}

	public void sendMailMessage() {
		this.mailSender.send(new MimeMessagePreparator() {

   			@Override
   			public void prepare(MimeMessage mimeMessage) throws Exception {
   				MimeMessageHelper helper =
   					new MimeMessageHelper(mimeMessage, true, "UTF-8");
   				helper.addTo("foo@bar.com");
   				helper.setFrom("bar@baz.com");
   				helper.addAttachment("test.txt", ...);
   				helper.setSubject("test subject with attachment");
   				helper.setText("mime body", false);
   			}
   		});
	}
}
----

=== Configuring regions
Amazon SES is not available in all https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/regions.html[regions] of the
Amazon Web Services cloud. Therefore an application hosted and operated in a region that does not support the mail
service will produce an error while using the mail service. Therefore the region must be overridden for the mail
sender configuration. The example below shows a typical combination of a region (EU-CENTRAL-1) that does not provide
an SES service where the client is overridden to use a valid region (EU-WEST-1).

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
<beans ...>

 <aws-context:context-region region="eu-central-1" />
 <aws-mail:mail-sender id="testSender" region="eu-west-1"/>

</beans>
----

=== Authenticating e-mails
To avoid any spam attacks on the Amazon SES mail service, applications without production access must
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-email-addresses.html[verify] each
e-mail receiver otherwise the mail sender will throw a `com.amazonaws.services.simpleemail.model.MessageRejectedException`.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html[Production access] can be requested
and will disable the need for mail address verification.
